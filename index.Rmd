## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to potentially gerrymandering statistics, potentially picking one county in a swing state that has gone a bunch of different ways and trying to make some sense of that data. I know that some counties voted for Obama then Trump then Biden, so maybe something to do with voting statistics in those counties. Otherwise prison gerrymandering might also be interesting to look into.
