(Visualizations should have informative labels andnames and have a small number of digits presented, using kable or modelssummary to nicley format)

extra point for:
- merging two different data sets
- additional analysis for possible confounders or alternative explinations (that poor economics mostly harm the incombent party)
## Introduction 

Research Question:
- hypothesis
- why this is interesting

## Data Section 
- breifly describes data source, 
- how key dependent and independent variables are measured
    - (eg survey, statistical model, or expert coding) 
- is this a cross sectional or differences in differences 
    
# Plot that summarizes the dependent variable 
  - so this is going to be my plot of unemployment rates for election years
  
  
## Results Section
  - this is going to have my four graphs of the elections results and maybe my oink graph if I can fix it
  - output for the main regression of interest
      - p value
  - interpret the main coefficient of interest in uyour regression 
  - comment the statistical significance of the estimated coefficient and whether or not you believe the coefficient to represent a causal effect 
      
## Conclusion 
  - summarizes results 
  - extent to which you find support for your hypotheis
  - limitations in data/how data could be improved
      - weak P value relationship, to properly do this experiment would need unployment data for all of these coutnies 
  - confounding factors
